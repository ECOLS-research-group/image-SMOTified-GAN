Sure! Here's a pseudocode for implementing a SMOTE-GAN for an imbalanced image dataset:

1. Load imbalanced image dataset
2. Calculate the class distribution of the dataset
3. Determine which classes are underrepresented
4. For each underrepresented class:
   - Perform oversampling using the SMOTE algorithm
   - Save the oversampled images to a new directory
5. Load the oversampled image dataset
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
7. Define the generator network with an additional input layer for class labels
8. Define the discriminator network with an additional input layer for class labels
9. Compile the generator and discriminator networks
10. Define the SMOTE-GAN model by connecting the generator and discriminator networks
11. Train the SMOTE-GAN model:
   - For each epoch:
     - Shuffle the training set
     - For each batch:
       - Generate random noise and class labels
       - Generate fake images using the generator network and the noise and class labels
       - Combine the real and fake images into a single batch
       - Train the discriminator on the batch with appropriate labels
       - Generate new random noise and class labels
       - Train the generator with the discriminator frozen and appropriate labels
   - Evaluate the SMOTE-GAN model on the testing set
12. Save the trained SMOTE-GAN model and the oversampled image dataset
